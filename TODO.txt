1. All administrators to specify global product discounts.  Since all discounts 
are percentage based and total order quantity is easy to measure, this should 
not be a problem.  Would the global rules override the product rules or vide 
versa?

2. This module shares a lot of administrative interface code with the 
uc_member_pricing module to make the interfaces consistent for the client.
Maybe abstract the administrative functionality into a general purpose module
that these two modules require?
